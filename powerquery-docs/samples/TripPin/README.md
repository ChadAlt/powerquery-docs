# TripPin Tutorial

This multi-part tutorial covers the creation of a new data source extension for Power Query. The tutorial is meant to be done sequentially&mdash;each lesson builds on the connector created in previous lessons, incrementally adding new capabilities to your connector.

This tutorial uses a public [OData](https://www.odata.org/documentation/) service ([TripPin](https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinService/)) as a reference source. Although this lesson requires the use of the M engine's OData functions, subsequent lessons will use [Web.Contents](/powerquery-m/web-contents), making it applicable to (most) REST APIs.

## Prerequisites

The following applications will be used throughout this tutorial:

* [Power BI Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45331), May 2017 release or later
* [Power Query SDK for Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/powerquerysdk)
* [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)&mdash;Optional, but recommended for viewing and debugging requests to your REST service

It's strongly suggested that you review:
* [Installing the PowerQuery SDK](../../InstallingSDK.md)
* [Start developing custom connectors](../../StartingToDevelopCustomConnectors.md)
* [Creating your first connector: Hello World](../../CreatingFirstConnector.md)
* [Handling Data Access](../../HandlingDataAccess.md)
* [Handling Authentication](../../HandlingAuthentication.md)

>[!Note]
>You can also start trace logging of your work at any time by enabling diagnostics, which is described later on in this tutorial. More information: [Enabling diagnostics](8-Diagnostics/README.md#enabling-diagnostics)
