## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you've properly configured the connection in the [Windows ODBC Data Source Administrator](/sql/odbc/admin/odbc-data-source-administrator). The exact process here will depend on the driver.

## Capabilities Supported

* Import
* Advanced options
  * Connection string (non-credential properties)
  * SQL statement
  * Supported row reduction clauses

## Connect to an ODBC data source from Power Query Desktop

To make the connection, take the following steps:

1. Select the **ODBC** option in the **Get Data** selection.

2. In **From ODBC**, select the data source name (DSN) from the **Data source name (DSN)** drop-down box. In this example, a DSN name of **SQL Server Database** was selected.

   You can also choose **Advanced options** to enter more optional connection information. More information: [Connect using advanced options](#connect-using-advanced-options)

3. Once you're done, select **OK**.

4. If this is the first time you are connecting to this database, select the authentication type and input your credentials when prompted.

   ![ODBC authentication in Power Query Desktop](./media/odbc/odbc-authentication.png)

   The authentication types available are:
   * **Default or Custom**: Select this authentication type when you don't specify any credentials if you're using DSN configured with a username and password. Or, if you need to include credentials as connection string properties.
   * **Windows**: Select this authentication type if you want to connect using Windows authentication. Optionally, include any connection string properties you need.
   * **Database**: Select this authentication type to use a username and password to access a data source with an ODBC driver. Optionally, include any connection string properties you need. This is the default selection.

   More information: [Authentication with a data source](../connectorauthentication.md)

5. Once you are done, select **Connect**.

6. In the **Navigator**, select the database information you want, then either select **Load** to load the data or **Transform Data** to continue transforming the data in Power Query Editor.

## Connect to an ODBC data source from Power Query Online

To make the connection, take the following steps:

1. From the **Data sources** page, select **ODBC**.

2. In the ODBC page, enter your ODBC connection string. In this example, the connection string is `dsn=SQL Server Database`.

3. If needed, select an on-premises data gateway in **Data gateway**.

4. Choose the authentication kind you'll use to sign in, and then enter your credentials.

5. Select **Next**.

6. In the **Navigator**, select the database information you want, and then select **Transform data** to continue transforming the data in Power Query Editor.

## Connect using advanced options

Power Query provides a set of advanced options that you can add to your query if needed.

![ODBC advanced options](./media/odbc/odbc-advanced-options.png)

| Advanced option | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Connection string (non-credential properties) | Provides an optional connection string that can be used instead of the **Data source name (DSN)** selection in Power BI Desktop. If **Data source name (DSN)** is set to **(None)**, you can enter a connection string here instead. For example, the following connection strings are valid: **dsn=_\<myDSN>_** or **driver=_\<myDriver>_;port=_\<myPortNumber>_;server=_\<myServer>_;database=_\<myDatabase>_;**. The `{ }` characters can be used to escape special characters. Keys for connection strings will vary between different ODBC drivers. Consult your ODBC driver provider for more information about valid connection strings. |
| SQL statement | Provides a SQL statement, depending on the capabilities of the driver. Ask your vendor for more information, or go to [Import data from a database using native database query](../native-database-query.md). |
| Supported row reduction clauses | Enables folding support for [Table.FirstN](/powerquery-m/table-firstn). Select **Detect** to find supported row reduction clauses, or select from one of the drop down options (TOP, LIMIT and OFFSET, LIMIT, or ANSI SQL-compatible). This option is not applicable when using a native SQL statement. Only available in Power Query Desktop. |
