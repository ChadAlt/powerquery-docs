## Prerequisites

You must have a SumTotal hosted environment with standard permissions to access the portal, and read permissions to access data in tables.

## Capabilities supported

* Import

## Finding your SumTotal hosted URL

Copy the SumTotal hosted root URL in full. This root URL is the unique URL specific to your instance. The URL will be in the format of **https://\<*yourdomain*>.sumtotal.host/**. Make sure not to copy the rest of the URL. Keep this URL somewhere handy so you can use it later.

## Connect to SumTotal BI from Power BI Desktop

>[!NOTE]
>The Power Query SumTotal connector is currently only suited towards OData API endpoints. For more information, see the [SumTotal OData API specification](https://marketplace.sumtotalsystems.com/Home/ODataAPI).

To connect to SumTotal from Power BI Desktop:

1. In the **Get Data** experience, select **SumTotal** in the **Other** category, and then select **Connect**.

2. Enter the server URL address of the data you want to load.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You'll be prompted with a script error; this is expected and loads the JS/CSS scripts that the login form uses. Select **Yes**.

3. When the table is loaded in **Navigator**, you'll be presented with the list of OData API entities that are currently supported by the connector. You can select to load one or multiple entities.

4. When you've finished selecting entities, select **Load** to load the data directly in Power BI desktop, or select **Transform Data** to transform the data.

>[!NOTE]
>If this is the first time you're connecting to this site, select **Sign in** and input your credentials. Then select **Connect**.

## Known issues and limitations

This section describes any limitations or considerations of the SumTotal connector.

### SumTotal OData API performance and throttling limits

For information about OData API performance and throttling limits for SumTotal connections, see the [SumTotal's OData API specification](https://marketplace.sumtotalsystems.com/Home/ODataAPI) under the **Important Notes** section. These limitations apply to both the SumTotal connector (which uses the OData API) and the 'actual' OData Hosted API when accessing the same endpoints.

### Table retrieval rate

Most default tables are retrieved at approximately 1000 rows per second using the SumTotal connector. If you require faster retrieval rates, consider using the **RowVersionId** filter parameter. You can pass this parameter directly to the environment hosted URL by appending it as a query string parameter, for example, **https://{host}.sumtotalystems.com/?rowVersionId=1234**.
