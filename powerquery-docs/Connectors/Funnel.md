## Prerequisites

To use the Funnel connector, you need a Funnel subscription. Funnel helps you collect data from all your marketing platforms, transform it, and send it to the destinations you want, like Power BI (https://funnel.io/).

In the Funnel App, go to your account, navigate to the Microsoft Power BI page in the left navigation (if you can't see it, contact us). Follow the instructions on the page. You need to create a "View" that contains the fields you want to expose in Power BI.

## Capabilities Supported

   For each view, you can enter number of rolling months of data you want.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The default number of months is 12. If today is 22.03.2022, then you'll get data for the period 01.04.2021 through 22.03.2022.

   You can then either select **Load** to load the data or select **Transform Data** to transform the data.

## Known issues and limitations

* If a view contains too much data for one month, the connector will get a TOO_MANY_ROWS error.
