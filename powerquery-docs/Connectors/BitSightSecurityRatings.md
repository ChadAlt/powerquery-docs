## Connect to BitSight from Power BI Desktop

To connect to BitSight:

1. Retrieve API token from BitSight.

2. In Power BI Desktop, select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon, select **More** from the drop down, and search for **BitSight**.

3. If this is the first time you're getting the data through the BitSight connector, a prompt appears to inform you of the connection to a third-party service.

4. Place your BitSight API token in Power BI. In the Window that appears, provide your credentials.

5. Once the connection is established, you can preview and select multiple data points in the **Navigator** dialog box to create an output.

You can **Load** the selected table, which brings the entire table into Power BI Desktop, or you can select **Transform Data** to edit the query, which opens the Power Query editor. You can then filter and refine the set of data you want to use, and then load that refined set of data into Power BI Desktop.
